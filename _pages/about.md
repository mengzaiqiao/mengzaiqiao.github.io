I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [Language Technology Laboratory (LTL)](http://ltl.mml.cam.ac.uk/) of  the **University of Cambridge**, working with Professor [Nigel Collier](https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/). Before that, I was a postdoc at [Terrier](http://terrierteam.dcs.gla.ac.uk/People.html) team of the University of Glasgow (UoG), working with Professor [Iadh Ounis](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/), Dr. [Richard McCreadie](http://dcs.gla.ac.uk/~richardm/Home/) and Dr. [Craig Macdonald](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm/) . I also have visited as a visiting PhD student at MINE lab of KAUST, working with Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://mine.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/ZhangX.aspx).  

I obtained my PhD in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in December 2018, working with Professor [Hong Shen](http://www.cs.adelaide.edu.au/~hong). I received my M.Sc from Guangdong University of Technology in 2011 and B.E from Jiangxi University of Science and Technology 2010 respectively. 

My research interests include developing Machine Learning algorithms, NLP, graph/relational structured data, including generating/optimizing graph structures, developing new graph neural network architectures, and applying these techniques in various domains. During my work at the University of Glasgow,  I mainly focused on the topic of grocery recommender systems, providing supports for the [Bigdatastack](https://www.bigdatastack.eu/use-cases) project on the use case application, which provides retailers with optimal insights into consumer preferences and improves the effectiveness of marketing strategies for improving consumer shopping experience.

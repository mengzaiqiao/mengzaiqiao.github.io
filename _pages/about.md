I’m now a postdoc at [Terrier](http://terrierteam.dcs.gla.ac.uk/People.html) team of the University of Glasgow (UoG). I obtained my PhD in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in December 2018, supervised by Prof. Hong Shen. Before joining SYSU, I received my M.Sc from Guangdong University of Technology in 2011 and B.E from Jiangxi University of Science and Technology 2010 respectively. 

My research interests include developing Machine Learning algorithms for graph/relational structured data, including generating/optimizing graph structures, developing new graph neural network architectures, and applying these techniques in various domains.

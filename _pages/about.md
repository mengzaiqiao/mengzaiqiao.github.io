I’m now a postdoc at [Terrier](http://terrierteam.dcs.gla.ac.uk/People.html) team of the University of Glasgow (UoG). I obtained my PhD in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in December 2018, working with Professor [Hong Shen](http://www.cs.adelaide.edu.au/~hong). Before joining SYSU, I received my M.Sc from Guangdong University of Technology in 2011 and B.E from Jiangxi University of Science and Technology 2010 respectively. 

My research interests include developing Machine Learning algorithms, graph/relational structured data, including generating/optimizing graph structures, developing new graph neural network architectures, and applying these techniques in various domains. Now I am working on the topic of grocery recommender systems, providing supports for the [Bigdatastack](https://www.bigdatastack.eu/use-cases) project on the use case application, which provides retailers with optimal insights into consumer preferences and improves the effectiveness of marketing strategies for improving consumer shopping experience.

## Introduction

SCAN is a semi-supervised co-embedding model for attributed networks based on the generalized SVAE for heterogeneous data, which collaboratively learns low-dimensional vector representations of both nodes and attributes for partially labelled attributed networks semi-supervisedly. The node and attribute embeddings obtained in a unified manner by our SCAN can benefit not only for capturing the proximities between nodes but also the affinities between nodes and attributes. Moreover, our model also trains a discriminative network to learn the label predictive distribution of nodes.

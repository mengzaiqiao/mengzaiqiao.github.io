## Introduction

Query diversification as an effective way to reduce query ambiguity and enhance result novelty has received much attention in top-k search applications on large networks. A major drawback of the existing diversification models is that they do not consider redundancy elimination during the course of search, resulting in unassured novelty in the search result. In this paper, to improve the novelty of the search result, we propose a new method of diversified top-k similarity search by combining diversification of node attribute coverage with a dissimilarity constraint. Due to the non-monotonicity implied by the dissimilarity constraint, existing techniques based on monotonicity assumptions cannot be applied. Our model requires solving a new problem of Dissimilarity Constrained Non-monotone Submodular Maximization (DCNSM). Based on constructing a dissimilarity-based graph, we solve this problem by a greedy â€¦

## Introduction

Search result diversification is an effective way to tackle query ambiguity and enhance result novelty. In the context of large information networks, diversifying search result is also critical for further design of applications such as link prediction and citation recommendation. In previous work, this problem has mainly been tackled in a way of implicit query intent. To further enhance the performance on attributed networks, we propose a novel search result diversification approach via nonnegative matrix factorization. Our approach encodes latent query intents as well as nodes as representation vectors by a novel nonnegative matrix factorization model, and the diversity of the results accounts for the query relevance and the novelty w.r.t. these vectors. To learn the representation vectors of nodes, we derive the multiplicative updating rules to train the nonnegative matrix factorization model. We perform a comprehensive â€¦

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher (Research Associate) at the [Language Technology Laboratory (LTL)](http://ltl.mml.cam.ac.uk/) of  the **University of Cambridge**, working with Professor [Nigel Collier](https://sites.google.com/site/nhcollier/). Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher (Research Assistant ) at the [Terrier](http://terrierteam.dcs.gla.ac.uk/People.html) team of the University of Glasgow (UoG), working with Professor [Iadh Ounis](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/), Dr. [Richard McCreadie](http://dcs.gla.ac.uk/~richardm/Home/) and Dr. [Craig Macdonald](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm/) . I also have been a visiting PhD student at the [MINE lab](https://mine.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx) of KAUST, working with Prof. [Xiangliang Zhang](https://mine.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/ZhangX.aspx).<br><br>

I obtained my Ph.D in computer science from Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU) in December 2018, working with Professor [Hong Shen](http://www.cs.adelaide.edu.au/~hong). <br><br>

I initialised the **Beta-Recsys** project, an open source project for Building, Evaluating and Tuning Automated Recommender Systems.
